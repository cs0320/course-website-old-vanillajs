# Instructions for Modifying the 32 Website

Staff pictures need to be in the img folder in .jpg format and must
be called <ta-login>.jpg.

The hover photos need to be called <ta-login>_hover.jpg, and must
be placed under the img/hover folder.

Each staff member's div must be updated manually to make the id
the staff member's login, and the footer text reflect the actual
name and login of the TA. Finding the pictures is handled automatically,
see js/cs32.js for more details!

Lecture information/resources must be updated manually.
